# Regression-Problem

The sheet 'Historical Data for ML analysis' has two tabs: -
1. Historical_Data - This tab has the training data, close to 12K records. 
2. Condiction for Predict - This tab has the data for which target variable needs to be predicted.

Different Regression algorithms of Machine Learning are used to solve this problem. As MAE, best one is choosen.

Also, preidcted data is captured in a separate sheet - 'Predicted Data for ML analysis'
